packEDU is a prototype iOS and Android application optimized for students in low-bandwidth situations. Students can download compact lesson content made by teachers which is parsed and rendered locally on the mobile phone. Lessons intermittently combine informative slides and interactive gamification elements.

The application has been tested on-site at a refugee education center in Amman, Jordan in order to verify efficacy of mobile learning applications in crisis situations.
